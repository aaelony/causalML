# Bank Marketing Campaign Causal Analysis Tutorial

In this project, we explore how we can use libraries such as DoWhy and EconMl to perform a causal analysis on a bank marketing dataset.

The dataset is from the UCI repository, which can be found [here]([UCI Machine Learning Repository: Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing))

This folder consists of the notebook (DOWHY_Tutorial) which will serve as the tutorial on performing a causal inference analysis of the data. In the notebook we step through the 4 processes of causal inference:

* Modeling
* Identification

* Estimation
* Refutation

Before proceeding into the causal analysis we also perform some data clean-up and exploratory data analysis to understand the data a bit more thoroughly.

The two causal inference questions we focus on in this tutorial are:

1. What is the effect of campaign frequency on the success of the marketing campaign?
2. What is the effect of marital status on the marketing campaign's success?
