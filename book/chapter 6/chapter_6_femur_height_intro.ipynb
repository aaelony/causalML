To emphasize this, I use the assignment operator “:=”, instead of the equal sign “=” to emphasize that fx and fy assign the values of x and y.\n",

To achieve this, we have to choose P(Nx), P(Ny), fx, and fy such that P(X) is still Normal(47, 2.3) and P(Y|X=x) is still Normal(25 + 3.3x, 3.3). One option is to do a simple reparameterization.
